        <p>My name is <strong>Javier</strong>, although in the wargaming community many know me as <strong><em>Zak</em></strong>.</p>
        <p>I've been fascinated by the world of miniatures since I was a child, and over the years, that passion turned into a true vocation. In 2010 I decided to take the leap and dedicate myself professionally to miniature painting.</p>
        <p>I'm specialized in historical armies, mainly in scales ranging from 6 mm to 28 mm, although I also work with other themes and sizes.</p>
        <p>I'm passionate about bringing each unit to life with historical accuracy, careful technique, and a distinct style. On this website, I share some of my work so you can see a sample of what I do.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, feel free to write to me through the contact section or find me on my blog and social media.</p>
